[Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tumpanjawat/diabetes-eda-random-forest-hp)

We are predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on various demographic, health, and lifestyle factors. The dataset includes information such as gender, age, presence of hypertension and heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. Our goal is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies individuals as either having or not having diabetes, which can help in early identification and management of the condition.

Explanation of Data columns:
- Gender - refers to the biological sex of the individual, which can have an impact on their susceptibility to diabetes. There are three categories in it male ,female and other.
- Age - is an important factor as diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in older adults.Age ranges from 0-80 in our dataset.
- Hypertension - is a medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It has values a 0 or 1 where 0 indicates they don’t have hypertension and for 1 it means they have hypertension.
- Heart disease - is another medical condition that is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes. It has values a 0 or 1 where 0 indicates they don’t have heart disease and for 1 it means they have heart disease.
- Smoking history - is also considered a risk factor for diabetes and can exacerbate the complications associated with diabetes.In our dataset we have 5 categories i.e not current,former,No Info,current,never and ever.
- BMI (Body Mass Index) - is a measure of body fat based on weight and height. Higher BMI values are linked to a higher risk of diabetes. The range of BMI in the dataset is from 10.16 to 71.55. BMI less than 18.5 is underweight, 18.5-24.9 is normal, 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30 or more is obese.
- HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) level - is a measure of a person's average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. Higher levels indicate a greater risk of developing diabetes. Mostly more than 6.5% of HbA1c Level indicates diabetes.
- Blood glucose level - refers to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream at a given time. High blood glucose levels are a key indicator of diabetes.
- Diabetes - is the target variable being predicted, with values of 1 indicating the presence of diabetes and 0 indicating the absence of diabetes.
